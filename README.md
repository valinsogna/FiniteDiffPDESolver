# Finite Difference Methods for PDEs

This repository contains implementations and solutions for exercises related to the finite difference methods to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).

## Contents

- **Exercise One:** Implementation of a finite difference method to approximate the solution of an elliptic PDE.
- **Exercise Two:** Studying the convergence of the method from the first exercise.
- **Exercise Three:** Analyzing the behavior of the solution from exercise one when the domain is changed.
- **Exercise Four:** Investigating the effect of the source term on the solution's behavior.
- **Exercise Five:** Time-dependent variation of the original PDE problem and solving it using the forward Euler's method.
- **Exercise Six:** Implementation of an algorithm to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix using LU factorization.

## Highlights

- **Spatial Discretization:** The project showcases different approaches to discretize the spatial component of the PDE.
- **Time-dependent Variation:** Exercise Five introduces time-dependence and demonstrates how to handle it with a forward Euler's approach.
- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:** The sixth exercise dives deep into the computation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for a matrix using LU factorization.

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
